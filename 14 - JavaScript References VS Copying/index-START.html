      // age = 200;

      // let name2 = name;
      // console.log(name, name2);

      // console.log(name, name2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;

      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";

      console.log(players, team);

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      // ⚠️ slice creates a copy of the array, when there are no arguments inside !!!

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      // ⚠️ the concat method "pushes" players into a new array too

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      // ⚠️ this is the BEST WAY TO DO IT
      team4[3] = "hello";
      console.log(players, team2, team3, team4);

      // or you can also do :
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      console.log(players, team5);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;
      // console.log(person, captain);
      // doesn't work because it updates person too !

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      console.log(person, cap2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      console.log(person, cap3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
      // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const gaut = {
        name: "Gautier",
        age: "28",
        social: {
          facebook: "Gautier Borot",

      };

      console.clear();
      // console.log(gaut);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, gaut);

      console.log(cap3, gaut, dev);

      // BUUUUUT if we need to modify the second level of the object (social) we need to do this :

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(gaut));

      dev2.social.facebook = "Gaut Gaut";
